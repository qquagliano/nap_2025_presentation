## Disclosure

- I have no disclosures or conflicts-of-interests related to this presentation

![](./imgs/spongebob_meme.jpg)

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the general goals of data analysis and statistics in both research
and applied settings

- Understand the core concepts and vocabulary used in machine learning/AI
techniques

- Compare and contrast the use-cases for "classic" statistical models versus
those better addressed by machine learning

- Survey the current state of research with these methods, specifically related
to the context of neuropsychological assessment

- Critically evaluate the practicality of using these methods in clinics, as
well as the procedural, ethical, and statistical problems associated with the
methods

## Motivation

- Born out of inspiration and frustration; neuropsychology has been credibly
accused of "falling behind" [@miller_technology_2017; @singh_technology_2021]

- Public and corporate pressure to adopt new and flashy technology, many already
see adoption of AI by providers as a goal [@hou_physician_2024]

- Omnipresence of AI- and machine learning-based tools, and proliferation of
AI-focused academic research, though not always really meshing with non-AI
focused research [@duede_oil_2024]

- Reflecting on my own role as both educator and consumer  

- Sharing my perspective of a cautious/skeptical optimist

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." -
Arthur C. Clark

## Purpose

- Today, I will primarily focus on methods described as machine learning
and "AI" and use cases in neuropsychological evaluation, specifically towards
prediction of patient cognition from psychological test scores.

- Review some prominent and recent findings from this booming area of research

- New benefits with these new techniques (which is exciting), but new challenges
as well...

- Disclaimer: Some cited articles are pre-prints and have not
yet undergone peer-review, please review cited studies before using
for decision-making

## Why Use Data Analysis and Statistics in Neuropsych Assessment?

- Evidence-based assessment  

- Build rapport, trust, and education in patients

- Improve validity and reliability of tests and results

- Public and academic perception of neuropsychology as valuable patient service

- Refinement of accuracy of diagnosis in assessment

## Review of Inferential and Frequentist Statistics

- Techniques such as z-test, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's R, OLS linear regression
and many others

- Result in p-values, beta coefficients, effect sizes, etc.

- Value comes from estimating probabilities and magnitude of outcomes, resulting
from different variables

- More explainable, tangible results

- Hypothetical Example
  - Linear regression predicting score on MoCA from age, education, gender (see
  coefficient table below)

| Variable                     | Beta  | P-value |
|-----------------------------|-------|---------|
| Age                         | -0.39 | 0.04    |
| Education                   | 1.94  | 0.001   |
| Gender (Male Dummy Code)    | 0.03  | 0.39    |

## Inferential Stats in the Wild

- Evidence of (convergent/concurrent) validity: correlation of FSIQ between
WAIS-IV and WAIS-5 - r = 0.92, statistically significant [@wechsler_wais-5_2025
p. 85]

- Quantifying average differences between different types of individuals: WMS-IV
LM I comparison between MCI (M = 8.4, SD = 2.7) and matched control group (M =
11.4, SD = 3.0) – t = 4.93, p < 0.01. [@wechsler_wms-iv_2009 p. 113]

- Developing appropriate normative data to compare our patients against and
establish relative cognitive ability - examples from [@mitrushina_handbook_2005 p. 649]:
  - Rooted in meta-analytical techniques
  - Predicting trailmaking test score from age -> 26.50094 - 0.2665049*age +
  0.0069935*age (+ additional education correction)

## Overview of Machine Learning (ML)

- Involves some type of computational "learning" -> model iterates through
available data and "trains" in some manner
  - Train -> Fit -> Assess -> Repeat

- Has existed for a long time, but has scaled up greatly with exponential rise
in technology

- Central goal of improving how accurate we can predict an outcome of interest
  - Prediction of a continuous outcome -> regression
  - Prediction of a categorial outcome -> classification
  - Instead of focus on p-values; more focus on Mean Squared Error (MSE),
  R-squared, etc.

- De-prioritizes giving exact, interpretable values to variables

- Is especially well suited to dealing with MANY different variables at one time

- Numerous techniques in this broad family - e.g. Classification and
Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Gradient-boosted Models (GBM), etc.

## Example: CART Model

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Example - CART Model [@lavery_cognitive_2007]

- Screener test (MMSE) score used as a predictor, alongside other cognitive
tests, with dementia as outcome

- MMSE scores are given binary splits (by the model) that produce distinct
classification odds of dementia

## What About "AI"?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Artificial intelligence, as we know it today, is largely a marketing
term encompassing extremely powerful and computationally expensive ML
models [@toh_looking_2019]

- There are some literature reviews that have tried to distinguish the terms
[@kuhl_artificial_2022]; but underlying mathematical methods are still the same
as ML.

- Still focused on stellar prediction via especially large datasets
and high computation power

- "Chat" services and note-writing assistance tools are using a framework called
a "large language models" (LLMs) and are already finding use in medical settings
[@thirunavukarasu_large_2023].

- LLMs involves predicting appropriate human-like language (outcome) in response
to prompts, context, and training data (predictors).

## Classic Stats vs. ML/AI

| Criteria                    | Classic Inferential Models                                                                 | ML/AI Models                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number of "trials"         | Fits one set of parameters for predictor/grouping variables (static)                        | Uses multiple iterations to improve parameters by some strategy or algorithm (dynamic)               |
| Primary focus or goal      | Inferring likelihood and magnitude of variable effects on an outcome                        | Accurate prediction of outcome, reducing amount of error                                              |
| Explain-ability of results | Reasonably able to interpret variables and the size of their contributions to the outcome   | Depending on the model, can be relatively difficult to understand how individual variables predict outcome |
| Difficulty of computation  | Low technology demand, mostly calculatable by hand                                          | Depending on the model, extremely taxing, large data and technological demand                        |
| Number of variables        | Less variables possible for certain tests (e.g., t-test), even multiple regression models restrict total number | Many more predictor variables, predictive power often scales with additional relevant data           |

## Summary of Research Applications

- ML/AI can extract insights from complex test data  

- Especially useful with large, multivariate sets  

- Most common in visuospatial testing so far  

- Can inform test selection and diagnostic decisions  

# Caution in the Clinic

## Procedural Challenges

- ML and "AI" tools may be costly to develop, run, or subscribe to (in the
case of commercial software products) and thus, may not be feasible to run on
in-clinic hardware or purchase within budget constraints [@crawford_atlas_2021].

- Clinicians and psychometrists need effective training in navigating and
understanding these models to use and apply them [@hedderich_ai_2021]

- Depending on the setup, it may be necessary to consider how patient data
privacy and confidentiality may be at risk when interacting with a model
[@chen_generative_2024]

## Ethical Concerns

- Though some healthcare professionals may be excited and have positive feelings
towards AI [@catalina_knowledge_2023], others may be more wary and object to its
use and the impact in may have on the workforce and staffing.

- Providers may feel concerned in fully trusting these models in being congruent
with their own judgments [@lebovitz_engage_2022], which is especially
concerning given the high stakes associated with diagnostic accuracy in
neuropsychological evaluations.

- Patient may feel less trust in total or partial reliance in "AI" tools in
medical care, compared to diagnostics only performed by providers
[@clements_prospective_2022]

## Statistical Pitfalls

- Unlike inferential statistical models, some ML and AI models deal with the
"black box" problem of not explaining the why of how predictions are made -
though work is being done to try to resolve this issue [@poon_opening_2021]

- AI may "hallucinate", i.e., predict
results completely incorrect or fundamentally flawed – as
it is effectively "guessing" or estimating a correct
response [@alkaissi_artificial_2023]

- ML and AI are reliant upon their training data and are thus biased
towards patterns existing in that data. When confronted with a case unlike those
in the training data, the model is liable to be biased towards
what it already "knows" [@barocas_fairness_2023]

# Future Steps {#sec-future-steps}

## Conclusion

- AI and machine learning is something to be excited about!... with caveats.

- Where there are many exciting developments in computational techniques for
analysis in neuropsychology, there are still many considerations to balance and
consider in applying these ideas

- Return to why we use statistics and quantitative analysis in practice, does
use of these new technologies support and enhance these?:
  - Evidence-based assessment  
  - Build rapport, trust, and education in patients
  - Improve validity and reliability of tests and results
  - Public and academic perception of neuropsychology as valuable patient service
  - Refinement of accuracy of diagnosis in assessment

- Psychometrists should be deliberate in building up a sufficient knowledge of
these technological advantages to weigh how to implement them in practice
