	abstract = {While still in its infancy, {ChatGPT} (Generative Pretrained Transformer), introduced in November 2022, is bound to hugely impact many industries, including healthcare, medical education, biomedical research, and scientific writing. Implications of {ChatGPT}, that new chatbot introduced by {OpenAI} on academic writing, is largely unknown. In response to the Journal of Medical Science (Cureus) Turing Test - call for case reports written with the assistance of {ChatGPT}, we present two cases one of homocystinuria-associated osteoporosis, and the other is on late-onset Pompe disease ({LOPD}), a rare metabolic disorder. We tested {ChatGPT} to write about the pathogenesis of these conditions. We documented the positive, negative, and rather troubling aspects of our newly introduced chatbot’s performance.},

	abstract = {Objective
              The rapid digitisation of healthcare data and the sheer volume being generated means that artificial intelligence ({AI}) is becoming a new reality in the practice of medicine. For this reason, describing the perception of primary care ({PC}) healthcare professionals on the use of {AI} as a healthcare tool and its impact in radiology is crucial to ensure its successful implementation.
            
            
              Methods
              Observational cross-sectional study, using the validated Shinners Artificial Intelligence Perception survey, aimed at all {PC} medical and nursing professionals in the health region of Central Catalonia.
            
            
              Results
              The survey was sent to 1068 health professionals, of whom 301 responded. And 85.7\% indicated that they understood the concept of {AI} but there were discrepancies in the use of this tool; 65.8\% indicated that they had not received any {AI} training and 91.4\% that they would like to receive training. The mean score for the professional impact of {AI} was 3.62 points out of 5 (standard deviation ({SD})  =  0.72), with a higher score among practitioners who had some prior knowledge of and interest in {AI}. The mean score for preparedness for {AI} was 2.76 points out of 5 ({SD}  =  0.70), with higher scores for nursing and those who use or do not know if they use {AI}.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The results of this study show that the majority of professionals understood the concept of {AI}, perceived its impact positively, and felt prepared for its implementation. In addition, despite being limited to a diagnostic aid, the implementation of {AI} in radiology was a high priority for these professionals.},

	abstract = {As advances in artificial intelligence ({AI}) continue to transform and revolutionize the field of medicine, understanding the potential uses of generative {AI} in health care becomes increasingly important. Generative {AI}, including models such as generative adversarial networks and large language models, shows promise in transforming medical diagnostics, research, treatment planning, and patient care. However, these data-intensive systems pose new threats to protected health information. This Viewpoint paper aims to explore various categories of generative {AI} in health care, including medical diagnostics, drug discovery, virtual health assistants, medical research, and clinical decision support, while identifying security and privacy threats within each phase of the life cycle of such systems (ie, data collection, model development, and implementation phases). The objectives of this study were to analyze the current state of generative {AI} in health care, identify opportunities and privacy and security challenges posed by integrating these technologies into existing health care infrastructure, and propose strategies for mitigating security and privacy risks. This study highlights the importance of addressing the security and privacy threats associated with generative {AI} in health care to ensure the safe and effective use of these systems. The findings of this study can inform the development of future generative {AI} systems in health care and help health care organizations better understand the potential benefits and risks associated with these systems. By examining the use cases and benefits of generative {AI} across diverse domains within health care, this paper contributes to theoretical discussions surrounding {AI} ethics, security vulnerabilities, and data privacy regulations. In addition, this study provides practical insights for stakeholders looking to adopt generative {AI} solutions within their organizations.},

However, there remains scant literature on the perspective of patients regarding clinical use of this technology. This study aimed to assess the opinion of radiology patients on the potential involvement of {AI} in the ir medical care. {DESIGN} A survey was given to ambulatory outpatients attending our hospital for medical imaging. The survey consisted of questions concerning comfort with radiologist reports, comfort with entirely {AI} reports, comfort with in -part {AI} reports, accuracy, data security, and medicolegal risk. {SETTING} Tertiary academic hospital in Melbourne, Australia. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES} Patients were surveyed for their overall comfort with the use of {AI} in their medical imaging using a Likert scale of 0 to 7.
{RESULTS} 283 patient surveys were included. Patients rated comfort in their imaging being reported by a radiologist at mean of 6.5 out of 7, compared with {AI} alone at mean 3.5 out of 7 (p{\textless}0.0001), or in-part {AI} at mean 5.4 out of 7 (p{\textless}0.0001). Patients felt {AI} should have an accuracy of mean 91.4\% to be able to be used in a clinical environment. Patients rated their current comfort with data security at mean 5.5 out of 7 however comfort with data security using {AI} at mean 4.4 out of 7, p{\textless}0.0001.
{CONCLUSIONS} Patients are trusting of the holistic role of a radiologist however, remain uncomfortable with clinical use of {AI} as a standalone product including accuracy and data security. If {AI} technology is to evolve then it must do so with appropriate involvement of stakeholders, of which patients are paramount.},

Drawing on more than a decade of research, award+'winning science, and technology, Crawford reveals how {AI} is a technology of extraction: from the energy and minerals needed to build and sustain its infrastructure, to the exploited workers behind "automated" services, to the data {AI} collects from us. Rather than taking a narrow focus on code and algorithms, Crawford offers us a political and a material perspective on what it takes to make artificial intelligence and where it goes wrong.

The participants’ attitude towards {AI} in medical imaging was very optimistic before and after the course. However, deeper knowledge of {AI} and the process for validating and deploying it resulted in significantly less overoptimism with respect to perceivable patient benefits through {AI} (p = 0.020). Self-assessed skill ratings significantly improved after the course, and the appreciation of the course content was very positive. However, we observed a substantial drop-out rate, mostly attributed to the lack of time of medical professionals. There is a high demand for educational offerings regarding {AI} in medical imaging among medical professionals, and better education may lead to a more realistic appreciation of clinical adoption. However, time constraints imposed by a busy clinical schedule need to be taken into account for successful education of medical professionals.},

              The Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) is a widely employed screening tool for the severity of cognitive impairment. Among the {MMSE} items, the pentagon copying test ({PCT}) requires participants to accurately replicate a sample of two interlocking pentagons. While the {PCT} is traditionally scored on a binary scale, there have been limited developments of granular scoring scale to assess task performance. In this paper, we present a novel three-stage algorithm, called Quantification of Interlocking Pentagons ({QIP}) which quantifies {PCT} performance by computing the areas of individual pentagons and their intersection areas, and a balance ratio between the areas of the two individual pentagons. The three stages of the {QIP} algorithm include: (1) detection of line segments, (2) unraveling of the interlocking pentagons, and (3) quantification of areas. A set of 497 {PCTs} from 84 participants including their baseline and follow-up {PCTs} from the Rush Memory and Aging Project was selected blinded about their cognitive and clinical status. Analysis of the quantified data revealed a significant inverse relationship between age and balance ratio  (beta = − 0.49,
              p
               = 0.0033), indicating that older age was associated with a smaller balance ratio. In addition, balance ratio was associated with  perceptual speed (r = 0.71,
              p
               = 0.0135), vascular risk factors (beta = − 3.96,

              p
               = 0.0389). The {QIP} algorithm can serve as a useful tool for enhancing the scoring of performance in the {PCT}.},

            Within the last decade, the application of “artificial intelligence” and “machine learning” has become popular across multiple disciplines, especially in information systems. The two terms are still used inconsistently in academia and industry—sometimes as synonyms, sometimes with different meanings. With this work, we try to clarify the relationship between these concepts. We review the relevant literature and develop a conceptual framework to specify the role of machine learning in building (artificial) intelligent agents. Additionally, we propose a consistent typology for {AI}-based information systems. We contribute to a deeper understanding of the nature of both concepts and to more terminological clarity and guidance—as a starting point for interdisciplinary discussions and future research.},

              Background
              The Rey Complex Figure Test ({RCFT}) has been widely used to evaluate the neurocognitive functions in various clinical groups with a broad range of ages. However, despite its usefulness, the scoring method is as complex as the figure. Such a complicated scoring system can lead to the risk of reducing the extent of agreement among raters. Although several attempts have been made to use {RCFT} in clinical settings in a digitalized format, little attention has been given to develop direct automatic scoring that is comparable to experienced psychologists. Therefore, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence ({AI}) scoring system for {RCFT} using a deep learning ({DL}) algorithm and confirmed its validity.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A total of 6680 subjects were enrolled in the Gwangju Alzheimer’s and Related Dementia cohort registry, Korea, from January 2015 to June 2021. We obtained 20,040 scanned images using three images per subject (copy, immediate recall, and delayed recall) and scores rated by 32 experienced psychologists. We trained the automated scoring system using the {DenseNet} architecture. To increase the model performance, we improved the quality of training data by re-examining some images with poor results (mean absolute error ({MAE})

                5 [points]) and re-trained our model. Finally, we conducted an external validation with 150 images scored by five experienced psychologists.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                For fivefold cross-validation, our first model obtained {MAE} = 1.24 [points] and

                ) = 0.977. However, after evaluating and updating the model, the performance of the final model was improved ({MAE} = 0.95 [points],

                between {AI} and average scores by five human experts were 0.64 [points] and 0.994, respectively.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              We concluded that there was no fundamental difference between the rating scores of experienced psychologists and those of our {AI} scoring system. We expect that our {AI} psychologist will be able to contribute to screen the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease pathology in medical checkup centers or large-scale community-based research institutes in a faster and cost-effective way.},

            One of the biggest challenges of utilizing artificial intelligence ({AI}) in medicine is that physicians are reluctant to trust and adopt something that they do not fully understand and regarded as a “black box.” Machine Learning ({ML}) can assist in reading radiological, endoscopic and histological pictures, suggesting diagnosis and predict disease outcome, and even recommending therapy and surgical decisions. However, clinical adoption of these {AI} tools has been slow because of a lack of trust. Besides clinician's doubt, patients lacking confidence with {AI}‐powered technologies also hamper development. While they may accept the reality that human errors can occur, little tolerance of machine error is anticipated. In order to implement {AI} medicine successfully, interpretability of {ML} algorithm needs to improve. Opening the black box in {AI} medicine needs to take a stepwise approach. Small steps of biological explanation and clinical experience in {ML} algorithm can help to build trust and acceptance. {AI} software developers will have to clearly demonstrate that when the {ML} technologies are integrated into the clinical decision‐making process, they can actually help to improve clinical outcome. Enhancing interpretability of {ML} algorithm is a crucial step in adopting {AI} in medicine.},

            Hand drawing, which requires multiple neural systems for planning and controlling sequential movements, is a useful cognitive test for older adults. However, the conventional visual assessment of these drawings only captures limited attributes and overlooks subtle details that could help track cognitive states. Here, we utilized a deep-learning model, {PentaMind}, to examine cognition-related features from hand-drawn images of intersecting pentagons. {PentaMind}, trained on 13,777 images from 3111 participants in three aging cohorts, explained 23.3\% of the variance in the global cognitive scores, 1.92 times more than the conventional rating. This accuracy improvement was due to capturing additional drawing features associated with motor impairments and cerebrovascular pathologies. By systematically modifying the input images, we discovered several important drawing attributes for cognition, including line waviness. Our results demonstrate that deep learning models can extract novel drawing metrics to improve the assessment and monitoring of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.},

              This preregistered study aimed to assess whether {AI}-generated coaching helps students to successfully feign attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) in adulthood. First, based on questions generated by 22 students, we conducted an extensive {ChatGPT} query to develop a concise {AI}-generated information sheet designed to coach students in feigning {ADHD} during a clinical assessment. Second, we evaluated the effect of this coaching in an experimental analogue study in which 110 university students were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) a control group (
              n
               = 42), (2) an {ADHD} symptom–coached simulation group (
              n

              n
               = 33). All participants underwent a clinical neuropsychological assessment that included measures of {ADHD} symptoms, functional impairments, selective attention, and working memory. Our preregistered data analysis revealed that the {AI}-coached simulation group consistently moderated their symptom overreporting and cognitive underperformance compared to the symptom-coached group in small to medium size, resulting in lower detection sensitivity. We conclude that publicly accessible {AI} tools, such as current versions of chatbots, can provide clear and effective strategies for feigning {ADHD} during clinical neuropsychological assessments, posing a significant threat to the validity assessments. We recommend that researchers and clinicians exercise caution when sharing assessment materials, example items, and scoring methodologies.},

              Background
              Widely used neuropsychological test instruments are notoriously biased across the demographics of age, sex/gender, education, language and culture. This includes verbal memory tests that elicit speech such as the paragraph recall or list‐learning memory tests. Language tests are similarly biased, including the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Cookie Theft Test ({CTT}) that has been used to elicit both written and spoken responses for decades. Biased tests generate biased results, and this problem is exacerbated by the widespread practice of repurposing tests generated for those in largely high income, Westernized countries for use in other countries that are demographically and culturally distinct. We tested the use of large language model ({LLM}) tools to automatically generate verbal test stimuli that were more locally relevant.
            
            
              Methods
              Starting with the {CTT}, that involves describing a picture that contains 14 core content units, we used {ChatGPT} to aid in generating customized pictures with the same number of core content units that were more universally relevant, (e.g., open park area, beach, etc.) by suggesting parameters and integrating resulting features into new pictures. We also tested capabilities to generate pictorial scenes that are more representative of regional settings, such as the Asia Pacific or Middle East. We are testing {LLM} capacity to generate similarly regionally customized list learning stimuli that maintain the original list learning test word frequency and difficulty across languages.
            
            
              Results
              Using an iterative approach, we were able to use automated artificial intelligence ({AI})‐driven tools to rapidly generate regionally relevant test stimuli that retained the original test characteristics to preserve generation of comparable results. Descriptive comparisons found that aided by automated {AI} tool, we could generate new neuropsychological test stimuli in a matter of minutes compared to months long manual methods.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The rapid emergence of {AI} has generated significant concerns about its appropriate use for health and health care applications. Given that {AI} is here to stay, we are testing the capacity of this technological advance to address long‐standing, persistent problems in {AD} research and usher in a new era of precision brain health that has global relevance in a rapidly aging world population.},

	abstract = {Problem definition: Artificial intelligence ({AI}) assistants—software agents that can perform tasks or services for individuals—are among the most promising {AI} applications. However, little is known about the adoption of {AI} assistants by service providers (i.e., physicians) in a real-world healthcare setting. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the {AI} smartness (i.e., whether the {AI} assistant is powered by machine learning intelligence) and the impact of {AI} transparency (i.e., whether physicians are informed of the {AI} assistant). Methodology/results: We collaborate with a leading healthcare platform to run a field experiment in which we compare physicians’ adoption behavior, that is, adoption rate and adoption timing, of smart and automated {AI} assistants under transparent and non-transparent conditions. We find that the smartness can increase the adoption rate and shorten the adoption timing, whereas the transparency can only shorten the adoption timing. Moreover, the impact of {AI} transparency on the adoption rate is contingent on the smartness level of the {AI} assistant: the transparency increases the adoption rate only when the {AI} assistant is not equipped with smart algorithms and fails to do so when the {AI} assistant is smart. Managerial implications: Our study can guide platforms in designing their {AI} strategies. Platforms should improve the smartness of {AI} assistants. If such an improvement is too costly, the platform should transparentize the {AI} assistant, especially when it is not smart.

We observe exponential growth, with {AI}-engaged publications increasing approximately thirteenfold (13x) across all fields, suggesting a dramatic shift from niche to mainstream. Moreover, we provide the first empirical examination of the distribution of {AI}-engaged publications across publication venues within individual fields, with results that reveal a broadening of {AI} engagement within disciplines. While this broadening engagement suggests a move toward greater disciplinary integration in every field, increased ubiquity is associated with a semantic tension between {AI}-engaged research and more traditional disciplinary research. Through an analysis of tens of millions of document embeddings, we observe a complex interplay between {AI}-engaged and non-{AI}-engaged research within and across fields, suggesting that increasing ubiquity is something of an oil-and-water phenomenon -- {AI}-engaged work is spreading out over fields, but not mixing well with non-{AI}-engaged work.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) technologies promise to transform how professionals conduct knowledge work by augmenting their capabilities for making professional judgments. We know little, however, about how human-{AI} augmentation takes place in practice. Yet, gaining this understanding is particularly important when professionals use {AI} tools to form judgments on critical decisions. We conducted an in-depth field study in a major U.S. hospital where {AI} tools were used in three departments by diagnostic radiologists making breast cancer, lung cancer, and bone age determinations. The study illustrates the hindering effects of opacity that professionals experienced when using {AI} tools and explores how these professionals grappled with it in practice. In all three departments, this opacity resulted in professionals experiencing increased uncertainty because {AI} tool results often diverged from their initial judgment without providing underlying reasoning. Only in one department (of the three) did professionals consistently incorporate {AI} results into their final judgments, achieving what we call engaged augmentation. These professionals invested in {AI} interrogation practices—practices enacted by human experts to relate their own knowledge claims to {AI} knowledge claims. Professionals in the other two departments did not enact such practices and did not incorporate {AI} inputs into their final decisions, which we call unengaged “augmentation.” Our study unpacks the challenges involved in augmenting professional judgment with powerful, yet opaque, technologies and contributes to literature on {AI} adoption in knowledge work.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              Identification of individuals with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) who are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is crucial for early intervention and selection of clinical trials.
            
            
              {METHODS}
              
                We applied natural language processing techniques along with machine learning methods to develop a method for automated prediction of progression to {AD} within 6 years using speech. The study design was evaluated on the neuropsychological test interviews of
                n
                 = 166 participants from the Framingham Heart Study, comprising 90 progressive {MCI} and 76 stable {MCI} cases.
              
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              Our best models, which used features generated from speech data, as well as age, sex, and education level, achieved an accuracy of 78.5\% and a sensitivity of 81.1\% to predict {MCI}‐to‐{AD} progression within 6 years.
            
            
              {DISCUSSION}
              The proposed method offers a fully automated procedure, providing an opportunity to develop an inexpensive, broadly accessible, and easy‐to‐administer screening tool for {MCI}‐to‐{AD} progression prediction, facilitating development of remote assessment.
            
            
              Highlights
              
                
                  
                    Voice recordings from neuropsychological exams coupled with basic demographics can lead to strong predictive models of progression to dementia from mild cognitive impairment.
                  
                  
                    The study leveraged {AI} methods for speech recognition and processed the resulting text using language models.
                  
                  
                    The developed {AI}‐powered pipeline can lead to fully automated assessment that could enable remote and cost‐effective screening and prognosis for Alzehimer's disease.},
